		<h1> About Me! </h1> 
		<p> I love to Read, Watch Movies & Tv Shows, Draw, listen to music. </p>
		<p> My favorite TV show right now is Mr. Queen. </p>
		<p> I have a few artists I like Ozuna, Shakira, Camilo, Le Serafim, NewJeans, and more artists. I'm also really into exploring different music especially those with different languages. </p>
		<p> I currently don't have a favorite book but I am reading A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, and Check & Mate. </p>
		<p> Outside Of school I work part-time in Panera, I also take care of my nieces every now and then and am part of the book club. </p>
